# üõ©Ô∏è Pilot Performance Modeling and Simulation

This group project for **SKIH2123 ‚Äì Modeling and Simulation (Universiti Utara Malaysia)** focuses on understanding how physical, psychological, and environmental factors affect **fighter pilot performance** under different mission conditions.

We developed a **mathematical model** using **Octave (MATLAB)** to simulate how variables such as **heart rate, sleep quality, mission complexity, experience level,** and **environmental stressors** influence **cognitive load, stress, fatigue, situational awareness,** and **overall performance**.

Unlike machine learning, this approach emphasizes **explainable cause-and-effect relationships**, helping visualize how performance evolves over time through simulation. The model was validated using **unit testing, integration testing, sensitivity analysis,** and **p-value verification** to ensure accuracy.

A prototype interface (Figma) was designed to display pilot performance reports, supporting **pilots, trainers,** and **commanders** in adaptive training and mission planning.
